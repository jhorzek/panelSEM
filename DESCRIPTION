Description: The package provides a simplified interface to fit dynamic panel data models. 
    The class of models that can be estimated ranges from simple linear models 
    (e.g., the cross-lagged panel model) to complex nonlinear nonadditive models 
    with observed and unobserved effect heterogeneity.
